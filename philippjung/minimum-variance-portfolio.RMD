# Minimum Variance Portfolio

## Data
The data being used is provided by Kenneth French. The well known dataset '10 Industry Portfolios' contains 10 portfolios of different US-companies.

![Explanation 10 Industry Portfolios](10-industry-portfolios-explanation.png)

### Loading the data
Read 'average value weighted returns (monthly)' from line 12 to line 1121
```{r 10-industry-portfolios}
return_matrix = read.csv('10_Industry_Portfolios.CSV', header=TRUE, sep=',', skip = 11, nrows = 1109)
head(return_matrix)
```

## Calculate returns
Returns are generally [calculated logarithmically](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/why-log-returns/), such that, considering a time-series of prices ${p_1, p_2, ..., p_T}$, the return at time i+1 is given by $$r_{i+1} = ln(p_{i+1}/p_{i}).$$
Just a side-note as we thankfully already work with a return_matrix.

## Interpret the problem as a system of linear equations
As written in DeMiguel, we choose the weights according to the portfolio that minimizes the variance of return, e.g. 
$$\min_{w_t} w_t^{\perp}\Sigma_{t}w_{t}$$
under the restriction that $1_{N}^{\perp}w_{t} \overset{!}{=} 1$. 
$$\Sigma_t w_t \overset{!}{=} 1$$,
where $\Sigma_t$ is the covariance matrix of the excess-returns $R_t$ at time $t$. If there are N risky assets considered, 1 is thought of as the N-dimensional vector containing 1's. 

In the following section, the restriction $\min_{w_t}$ shall be investigated for one fixed time-period T, such that weights are not time-dependent anymore. Considering 3 risky assets and ${w_1, w_2, \dots, w_N}$ 3 weights, the minimal variance restraind can be interpreted as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{w_1, w_2, w_3} \sigma^2_{w_1, w_2, w_3} = & w^2_1 \sigma^2_1 + w^2_2 \sigma^2_2 + w^2_3 \sigma^2_3 + \\ & 2w_1w_2 \sigma_{12} + 2w_1w_3\sigma_{13} + 2w_2w_3\sigma_{23}
\end{aligned}
$$
The Lagrange-function of this problem is
$$
\begin{aligned}
L(w_1, w_2, w_3, \lambda) =  & w^2_1 \sigma^2_1 + w^2_2 \sigma^2_2 + w^2_3 \sigma^2_3 + \\ & 2w_1w_2 \sigma_{12} + 2w_1w_3\sigma_{13} + 2w_2w_3\sigma_{23} \\
& + \lambda(w_1 + w_2 + w_3 - 1)
\end{aligned}
$$
Now, the component-wise deviates can be found and be restructured to form a linear system of equations.

## Computing the Covariance Matrix
As we saw in the section above, to minimize the overall variance, we first need to compute the covariance matrix. This can be achieved by applying the cov() function to the rows (t-th row for time t) of return_matrix.
```{r}
nA = dim(return_matrix[,-1])[2] # number of assets
cov_return_matrix = cov(return_matrix[,-1]) # dates are deleted
```
All positive values in the cov_return_matrix, meaning there is at least some linear relation between all the values. 

Above equation is of form
$$A \cdot x = b$$, thus a system of linear differential equations. Since $A = \Sigma$ and $b = 1$ are known, we can solve this system to obtain $x = R_t$ the 

```{r}
b = vector(length=nA) + 1
x = solve(cov_return_matrix, b)
x = x/sum(x)
x
```
Note that there are *negative weights*. These are interpreted as [short sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)).

# Computing the global minimum-variance portfolio tutorial
I first wanted to do this with datacamp, but then I came across [this tutorial](http://enricoschumann.net/R/minvar.htm) (the first hit on google really). So I just want to follow the steps described there to get an understanding for the method.

## Generate example-data
As an example dataset, we create artificial returns with mean zero (the default with rnorm) and volatility 5%. (This order of magnitude would be reasonable for monthly equity returns.) These returns are stored in a matrix mData. 
```{r}
nO = 100  ## number of observations
nA = 10   ## number of assets
artificial_return_matrix = array(rnorm(nO * nA, sd = 0.05), 
               dim = c(nO, nA)) 
head(artificial_return_matrix)
```
The following section describes different approaches to gaining the weights.

## Approach according to Washington State
This approach can be found in [this script](https://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ424/portfolioTheoryMatrix.pdf). The linear system of equations you come up with once you work on the Langrangian can be written as
$$
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_{NoDur}^{2} & \sigma_{NoDur, Durbl} & \dots & \sigma_{NoDur, Other} & 1 \\
    \sigma_{NoDur, Durbl} & \sigma_{Durbl}^2 & \dots & \vdots & 1\\
    \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    \sigma_{NoDur, Other} & \dots & \dots & \sigma_{Other}^2 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & \dots & 1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix} 
  \cdot 
  \begin{bmatrix}w_{NoDur} \\ w_{Durbl} \\ \vdots \\ w_{Other} \\ \lambda \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
  $$
This is just the same as 
$$ \begin{bmatrix}
      2 \Sigma & 1 \\
      1^{\intercal} &  0
    \end{bmatrix} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
      w \\
      \lambda
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0 \\ 1
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
which is a system of linear equations in matrix notation. 
## Solving a system of linear equations
To solve the above system, we can use the solve()-Function implemented in R. 
```{r}
ATop = cbind(2*cov_return_matrix, rep(1, nA))
ABotVec = c(rep(1, nA), 0)
A = rbind(ATop, ABotVec)
bVec = c(rep(0, nA), 1)
z.m.mat = solve(A) %*% bVec
mVec = z.m.mat[1:nA, 1]
mVec
```
which is exactly the same as if you dropped the whole $\lambda$ - equation.
